req: Does k3s run it's containers as root?
res:
Yes ‚Äî by default, when you run k3s (the lightweight Kubernetes distribution), the containers for your workloads typically run as **root (UID 0)** inside the container unless you explicitly override it. More precisely:

* Kubernetes (and thus k3s) allows containers to run as root unless a security context forbids it. ([Kubernetes][1])
* For example, one user discovered that inside k3s the process in a pod was UID 0 and that you can change that via `securityContext` settings. ([technik.blogs.nde.ag][2])
* k3s *itself* can be run in ‚Äúrootless‚Äù mode (so that the k3s server process on the host doesn‚Äôt run as root) ‚Äî but that is separate from what user the containers inside pods run as. ([K3s Documentation][3])

---

### üîê What you should consider

* Just because the container runs as root doesn‚Äôt mean it's automatically fully privileged on the host ‚Äî container runtimes still isolate things to some degree ‚Äî but running as root in the container means the process has UID 0 inside that namespace, which can be riskier from a security perspective.
* If you want to ensure your workloads don‚Äôt run as root, you should add a `securityContext` section to your Pod/Container spec, e.g.:

  ```yaml
  spec:
	securityContext:
	  runAsNonRoot: true
	  runAsUser: 1000
  ```

  This ensures the container is run with a non-root user. ([fairwinds.com][4])
* Even when the container runs as root, your underlying host OS may impose further restrictions (for example via seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux, capabilities), so "root in the container" is not the same as "root on the host".

If you like, I can verify for your exact version of k3s (you can tell me the version) whether the default behavior has changed (some distributions or installation configurations may choose non-root by default). Do you want me to look that up?

req: How does it compare to Podman's rootless containers? I've heard docker runs it's containers as root and has security issues.
res:
Good question. There are many moving parts here ‚Äî so I‚Äôll try to compare the key differences between how containers typically run under k3s (and by extension Kubernetes via containerd or another runtime) *vs.* how they run under Podman (especially rootless mode). We‚Äôll highlight advantages, trade-offs, and what ‚Äúrunning as root‚Äù exactly means in each case.

---

## ‚úÖ How things generally work: k3s / Kubernetes

* In Kubernetes (and by default in k3s), unless you explicitly specify otherwise, containers inside pods will run as **UID 0 (root)** inside the container. ([LearnKube][1])
* Running as root inside the container means the process has full container-root privileges. While the container isolates many things (namespaces, cgroups, SELinux/AppArmor, etc) it still broadens the ‚Äúblast radius‚Äù of a potential compromise. ([Marcin Wasiucionek][2])
* k3s supports a **rootless mode** (for the k3s server/agent itself) ‚Äî meaning you can run the *control plane/agent* without root privileges on the host. But that doesn‚Äôt automatically mean every container inside the cluster runs as non-root; you still need to enforce that via security contexts, pod policies, etc. ([K3s Documentation][3])
* Kubernetes provides features (via the `securityContext` in Pod/Container specs) to force non-root execution: e.g., `runAsUser`, `runAsNonRoot`, `runAsGroup`. If you don‚Äôt set them, default is root inside container. ([LearnKube][1])
* So in practice: if you deploy a workload in k3s and don‚Äôt care about specifying user, you‚Äôll very likely end up with root inside the container. That doesn‚Äôt mean the container environment is root on the host (depends on user namespace remapping), but it does increase risk.

---

## üîç How Podman (especially rootless mode) differs

* Podman was built with ‚Äúrootless containers‚Äù in mind (and daemonless) ‚Äî e.g., a regular user can run containers via Podman without needing sudo/root. ([Red Hat Developer][4])
* In rootless mode, Podman uses **user namespaces** to map the container‚Äôs root user to a non-root host user. So while inside the container you may see UID 0, on the host that process maps to an unprivileged UID. For example: ([SUSE Documentation][5])

  > ‚ÄúBy default, Podman launches containers as the current regular user ‚Ä¶ rootless containers cannot access and manipulate resources that require root privileges.‚Äù ([SUSE Documentation][5])
* Podman‚Äôs architecture: no root-owned daemon required (in rootless mode), which reduces one potential attack vector. ([von-neumann.ai][6])
* Rootless mode has some limitations: e.g., networking (user-namespace + slirp4netns) may be slower or more limited, privileged operations may not work. ([SUSE Documentation][5])
* Because the container runtime is not root (or the root inside container does not map to root on the host), a container breakout is much harder to escalate into full host root access (in the standard path). This gives a stronger ‚Äúleast privilege‚Äù posture.

([My blog][8])                                                               |

---

## üß† What this means for you & your cluster

* If in your k3s setup you haven‚Äôt set `runAsNonRoot` or `runAsUser`, your workloads might be running as root inside the container. That means if a container breakout occurs (via a vulnerability), the attacker may have a larger privilege level inside the container and possibly on the host (depending on runtime config).
* If you care about security (which is a good idea), you should enforce non-root containers in Kubernetes by using `securityContext`, PodSecurityPolicies/PodSecurityAdmission, etc. ([wiz.io][9])
* If you were using Podman rootless for individual containers, you‚Äôd get a better security posture in the sense that even if the container is root inside, at the host level it‚Äôs mapped to non-root.
* But since you are using k3s, your focus is likely on orchestrated workloads ‚Äî so you should apply Kubernetes-style security best practices regardless of runtime engine.
* Also: Even though Podman rootless is more secure from a host privilege escalation perspective, it‚Äôs not a silver bullet. There are limitations and trade-offs (performance, networking, compatibility) that you should understand. ([Opensource.com][10])
* For k3s itself you might consider running the control plane in rootless mode if host security is a big concern, but keep in mind k3s rootless mode is ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù. ([K3s Documentation][3])

---

## üîç My recommendation for your scenario

Since you‚Äôre using k3s on CachyOS and dealing with container/image issues (pulling images etc), it‚Äôs worth considering security hygiene while you fix operations issues. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Check what UID your containers run as inside the pods**
   For example:

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <pod> -- id
   ```

   If you see `uid=0(root)`, then the container process is root inside.

2. **Add securityContext defaults for your workloads**
   Example manifest snippet:

   ```yaml
   spec:
	 securityContext:
	   runAsNonRoot: true
	   runAsUser: 1000
	   runAsGroup: 1000
	 containers:
	 - name: app
	   image: yourimage
	   securityContext:
		 allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
		 capabilities:
		   drop:
		   - ALL
   ```

   This helps reduce risk. See best practices. ([Howik][11])

3. **Consider enforcing at namespace or cluster level**
   Use Pod Security Standards (PSA) or other admission controls to prevent containers from running as root unless explicitly needed. This raises the bar. ([Marcin Wasiucionek][2])

4. **If you want maximum isolation and host protection**
   Think about whether the container runtime and Kubernetes setup can be configured more tightly. For example, run the cluster‚Äôs components non-root, enable user namespaces, drop unnecessary capabilities.

5. **When using images that require root inside container**
   Some workloads still need root inside container (e.g., system software, certain daemons). In those cases you‚Äôll weigh the risk: accept root inside container but ensure host isolation is solid, or refactor the image to run as non-root.

req: In short, can I configure my pods in k3s to have the same or even better security and privilege restrictions as podman containers?
res:
Short answer: **Yes** ‚Äî you *can* configure pods in k3s (and by extension Kubernetes) to have the **same or even better privilege/security restrictions** as containers managed by Podman rootless mode. But it requires correctly setting up a number of features and cluster/node configurations ‚Äî it‚Äôs not automatic out of the box.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of **how** you can do it, what features you need, and what caveats to be aware of.

---

## ‚úÖ What you should configure for strong security

Here are key features and settings you should use so your pods approach Podman-rootless-level (or better) isolation:

### 1. Use a `securityContext` for Pod/Container

To restrict what containers can do, you want to apply a manifest like:

```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
	runAsNonRoot: true
	runAsUser: 1000
	runAsGroup: 1000
	fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
  - name: myapp
	image: your-image
	securityContext:
	  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
	  privileged: false
	  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
	  capabilities:
		drop: [ALL]
		add: []
```

These follow guidance from official docs and best-practices: e.g., drop unnecessary capabilities, disable privilege escalation. ([wiz.io][1])

### 2. Enforce Pod Security Standards / Admission Policies

Use the built-in Pod Security Standards (PSA) or an admission controller (e.g. Kyverno or OPA Gatekeeper) to enforce:

* `runAsNonRoot: true`
* `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
* No `privileged: true` containers
* No unnecessary host namespace usage (hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC) ([Kubernetes][2])

### 3. Use user namespaces (UID/GID remapping) for pods

A key differentiator: Podman rootless maps the container‚Äôs root (inside) to an unprivileged UID on the host. Kubernetes now has support for user namespaces for pods:

* Enabling `hostUsers: false` under pod spec triggers user namespace mode. ([Kubernetes][3])
* With this, even if the process inside the container is UID 0, on the host it maps to a non-root UID ‚Äî reducing risk of container breakout.
* Requirements: Node filesystem must support idmap mounts, container runtime (containerd or CRI-O) must support user namespaces. ([Kubernetes][4])
  This is a *big security win* and makes your pods potentially even safer than default Podman rootless (if configured correctly).

### 4. Use minimal permissions and avoid privileged mode

* Do *not* use `privileged: true`. Privileged containers bypass many kernel protections. ([Kubernetes][5])
* Drop all capabilities and only allow what‚Äôs needed.
* Avoid host namespace sharing unless absolutely required (hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC) ‚Äî these increase host exposure. ([Kubernetes][6])
* Make root filesystem read-only if possible: `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`. ([Snyk][7])

### 5. Network / Volume / RBAC isolation

* Use Network Policies to restrict communication between pods and namespaces.
* Use dedicated ServiceAccounts (not the default) and minimal RBAC permissions. ([Kubernetes][8])
* For volumes: avoid `hostPath` unless absolutely necessary; restrict what host resources the container can reach.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What to watch out for / limitations

* The user namespace feature in Kubernetes is **relatively new** (beta/alpha in some versions) and may have limitations depending on your runtime/distribution. ([Kubernetes][9])
* Some workloads require root inside the container or host network/privileged access ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to make trade-offs in those cases.
* You must configure your node and runtime appropriately (e.g., enabling user namespace support, ensuring your filesystem supports idmap mounts) for the best isolation. ‚úèÔ∏è
* Even with strong configs, container runtime vulnerabilities or host misconfigurations can still compromise security ‚Äî this is defense-in-depth, not a guarantee.
* Podman rootless is simpler to set up for single-container environments; orchestrated clusters add complexity (networking, scheduler, admission controllers etc).

---

## üîç So in short

Yes ‚Äî by using the features above, your k3s-based pods *can* be configured to be at least **as secure** as Podman rootless containers, and potentially **even more secure** (because you can enforce cluster-wide policy, use user namespaces, network/volume isolation, admission controls).
But it **requires** the effort of configuring and enforcing those security controls; it‚Äôs not the default state.

If you like, I can pull together a **sample manifest/template** for your environment (k3s on CachyOS) that you can use as a ‚Äúsecure pod baseline‚Äù to apply to your workloads. Would that be helpful?
